Overview
--------
This Client Trust Account Management System is a Python-based application designed to automate financial transactions and record-keeping for a Residential Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center. 
Patients are not allowed to handle money directly, so this system manages deposits, withdrawals, and store balances through an internal commissary system.
The system reduces manual data entry and financial reconciliation efforts by at least 50%, automating processes with Python, PyQt5 for the GUI, Microsoft Access, and Excel automation.

Features
--------
- GUI Interface: Built using PyQt5 for ease of use.
- Automated Data Entry: Handles deposits, withdrawals, and store list generation.
- Microsoft Access Integration: Uses PyODBC to connect to a client trust database.
- Excel Automation: Uses OpenPyXL and xlwings to generate and modify reports.
- Error Handling and Logging: Ensures smooth operations with exception handling and debug logs.

Tech
